Time4Maps
=========

The Web client TIME4MAPS has been developed to enable a simple visual analysis of such data without installation of a massive GIS or other software. TIME4MAPS shows spatio-temporal changes of environmental data. The data must be provided by an OGC WMS service (1.1.1 or 1.3.0). The interactive map client enables to select spatial and temporal extent of the map and to control the animated map with a time slider. A click on the map provides concrete information and values of the selected point for the actual time step.
